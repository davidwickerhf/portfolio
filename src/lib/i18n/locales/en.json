      "work": "During my internship at Mediamente Consulting, a Business Intelligence company in Turin, I was tasked with developing a car booking system for managing internal employee rentals. I began by designing the website pages using Figma, and once approved, I proceeded to implement the design on the company's codebase. To bring the car booking system to life, I utilized PHP, raw JavaScript, and SCSS. I carefully developed the backend functionalities using PHP to ensure seamless communication with the company's database. With JavaScript, I added interactive elements and dynamic features to enhance the user experience.",

I was exposed to the tragic history of the Armenian genocide, perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire, which, even today, lacks full international recognition. Additionally, I learned about the ongoing conflicts and wars between Armenia and Azerbaijan concerning the Nogorno Karabakh region. These experiences shed light on the struggles endured by Armenian youth, who live with the constant fear of being conscripted into the army from a young age. Witnessing these hardships firsthand awakened my empathy and strengthened my commitment to advocating for justice and peace. It deepened my appreciation for the resilience and determination of the Armenian people, who persist in the face of adversity. This experience prompted me to organize a project to raise awareness about the struggles of the Armenian people in my high school in northern Italy.",
