Working closely with my supervisor, I utilized my skills in PHP and JavaScript to create a robust system. Once completed, I seamlessly integrated the booking system into the company's existing website code base. This valuable hands-on experience allowed me to apply my programming knowledge in a real-world setting, honing my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, it provided me with a deeper understanding of the practical applications of software development within a professional environment.",
      "issues": {
        "1": "Working with an existing code base written by another author posed challenges, especially since it was originally designed as a standalone static website and not a web app. To make the necessary modifications, I had to implement a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture from scratch using vanilla PHP and JavaScript. This involved understanding the existing code structure, identifying the key components, and redesigning them to fit the requirements of the booking system.",
        "2": "Connecting the backend and frontend proved to be a challenge due to the absence of a framework in the original code base. This meant that managing the communication and data flow between the backend and frontend had to be handled manually. To achieve this, I relied on jQuery to handle dynamic updates to the user interface (UI) and synchronize the data with the backend. It required meticulous attention to detail and careful coordination to ensure a seamless integration between the different components of the system.",
        "3": "One additional hurdle I faced was learning PHP on the go. Since I took on the project without prior knowledge of PHP, I had to quickly familiarize myself with the language to effectively navigate and work with the existing code base. This involved studying PHP syntax, understanding its principles, and leveraging online resources and documentation to grasp the intricacies of the language. It was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to expand my programming skills and adapt to new technologies and frameworks."

The war began on September 27, 2020, when intense fighting broke out along the line of contact between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces. The conflict saw heavy artillery shelling, air strikes, and ground offensives from both sides. The use of advanced weaponry, including drones, played a significant role in the hostilities. Azerbaijan made significant territorial gains during the war, recapturing several districts surrounding the Nagorno-Karabakh region that had been under Armenian control since the early 1990s. The Azerbaijani forces also advanced into parts of Nagorno-Karabakh itself, including the strategically important city of Shusha. The war resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides, including civilians, and led to the displacement of thousands of people. There were also reports of war crimes and human rights abuses committed by both Armenian and Azerbaijani forces. A ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia was signed on November 10, 2020, effectively ending the active phase of the conflict. Under the agreement, Azerbaijan retained control over the territories it had recaptured during the war, while a Russian peacekeeping contingent was deployed to oversee the ceasefire and ensure stability in the region. The war had significant political and humanitarian implications, reshaping the balance of power in the region and prompting discussions about the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Efforts to address the underlying issues and find a lasting peaceful solution to the conflict continue through diplomatic negotiations mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs (Russia, France, and the United States)."

The genocide aimed to eliminate the Armenian population and involved mass killings, forced deportations, and death marches.  In 1915, the Ottoman government enacted the Tehcir Law, which authorized the deportation and relocation of Armenians from their ancestral lands. Under the pretext of national security, Armenians were rounded up from their homes, separated from their families, and forced to march long distances to detention centers and concentration camps. These forced deportations resulted in widespread death and suffering.  The deportations were often accompanied by extreme violence, with Armenians subjected to brutal conditions, starvation, and massacres along the way. The marches of death referred to the grueling journeys endured by the deportees, where countless Armenians perished due to exhaustion, exposure to harsh elements, and systematic killings by Ottoman forces. Estimates of the number of Armenian victims vary, but it is widely accepted that over one million Armenians lost their lives during the genocide. The atrocities included mass killings, executions, forced labor, sexual violence, and the destruction of Armenian cultural and religious heritage."

During the declining years of the Ottoman Empire, a rising tide of nationalism and ethno-religious tensions fueled the desire for a homogenous Turkish state. The Armenian population, seen as a distinct ethnic and religious minority, became scapegoats for the empire's woes. The nationalist Young Turks movement, which gained power in 1908, sought to establish a Turkish-dominated empire and viewed the Armenians as a threat. With the outbreak of World War I, the Armenians were accused of collaborating with enemy forces, providing a pretext for their targeted extermination. Political and military leaders implemented a systematic campaign of deportation, mass killings, forced labor, and starvation, aiming to eradicate the Armenian presence from their historic homeland. The genocide's motivations included territorial expansion, ethno-religious nationalism, and the desire to eliminate perceived threats to the Ottoman Empire's stability."

The massacres were primarily motivated by religious and ethnic tensions, as well as the desire to suppress Armenian nationalist aspirations. The first major wave of massacres occurred in 1894 in the city of Sasun, followed by widespread violence targeting Armenians in various regions of the empire. The deadliest phase took place between 1895 and 1896, with massacres occurring in cities such as Istanbul, Trebizond, Van, and Diyarbakir. While specific figures are disputed, it is estimated that over 300.000 Armenians were killed during this period. The atrocities involved mass killings, forced conversions, rape, looting, and destruction of Armenian villages and churches. The Hamidian Massacre served as a prelude to the later Armenian Genocide in 1915, highlighting the persistent persecution and violence faced by the Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire. The events of the Hamidian Massacre played a significant role in shaping the Armenian national consciousness and the subsequent struggle for recognition and justice."

Efforts for acknowledgment, justice, and remembrance continue as part of the Armenian struggle for recognition and the prevention of future genocides. The true scale of the Armenian Genocide may never be fully known due to the deliberate destruction of evidence and ongoing denial by some parties. \\n\\n The recognition of the Armenian Genocide has been a complex and contentious issue. Despite overwhelming evidence and scholarly consensus, the recognition of the genocide has faced significant challenges, primarily due to political considerations and denial by the Turkish government. Several countries, including Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, and Uruguay, have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide. The European Parliament, the Council of Europe, and the World Council of Churches have also acknowledged the genocide. However, recognition has been inconsistent, and some nations have been reluctant to use the term \"genocide\" for fear of straining diplomatic relations with Turkey. The Turkish government, successor to the Ottoman Empire, vehemently denies the term \"genocide\" and contends that the events were a result of wartime conditions. The denial of the Armenian Genocide has had lasting consequences, affecting the healing process, justice for the victims, and preventing the prevention of future genocides.  The Armenian diaspora, along with scholars, activists, and human rights organizations, continue to advocate for wider recognition and acknowledgment of the genocide. Efforts for recognition have gained momentum in recent years, with more countries, institutions, and public figures openly acknowledging the Armenian Genocide. The recognition and remembrance of the Armenian Genocide are crucial steps in confronting the past, honoring the victims, and preventing similar atrocities from occurring in the future. The Armenian Genocide was recognized by the United States of American only in 2023"

The conflict emerged when the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, primarily inhabited by ethnic Armenians, expressed its desire to join Armenia. In 1988, the regional legislature in Nagorno-Karabakh passed a resolution requesting the transfer of administrative control from Azerbaijan to Armenia. This led to protests and demonstrations, escalating tensions between the two communities. The conflict intensified in 1991 when both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Armed clashes erupted, resulting in a full-scale war between the two countries. The war witnessed significant military operations, including the shelling of cities, ethnic cleansing, and large-scale displacement of people. The war lasted until 1994 when a ceasefire agreement was signed, leaving Nagorno-Karabakh and several surrounding regions under the control of ethnic Armenian forces. Despite the ceasefire, the conflict remained unresolved, and sporadic clashes continued over the years, leading to casualties and tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan."

This was an extraordinary opportunity to engage with prominent figures and contribute to the dialogue surrounding climate change. Working closely with the Roman chapter of Fridays For Future, we organized a momentous strike in Piazza del Popolo. The strike attracted an impressive turnout, with over 50,000 individuals joining us to demand immediate action to address the climate crisis. This mass mobilization showcased the growing awareness and support for climate activism in Italy. At the Italian Senate, a significant meeting took place where I had the honor of meeting and engaging in discussions with President Casellati and Greta Thunberg herself. This meeting provided a vital platform to express our concerns, share our perspectives, and advocate for more ambitious climate policies and measures."

      "desc": "During the SMILE meeting, one of the agreed-upon initiatives was the call for local institutions to declare a Climate Emergency. I actively participated in the process of drafting and securing approval for two Climate Emergency Declaration motions. The first motion was organized in my hometown of Buttigliera Alta. Together with Erika Trulla, we wrote the motion and submitted it to the local council. After careful consideration, the motion was successfully approved, attracting attention and making headlines in the valley. Additionally, I contributed to the drafting of the Climate Emergency Declaration motion for the city of Turin. Collaborating closely with the city's councilor on environment, we worked to incorporate concrete proposals into the motion. Through our collective efforts, the motion was passed, signifying the city's commitment to addressing the climate crisis. Furthermore, I helped in development of the Climate Emergency Declaration motion for the regional government of Piedmont. Unfortunately, despite our collaborative work, the motion was ultimately voted down. By actively engaging with local institutions and advocating for Climate Emergency Declarations, we aimed to raise awareness and encourage action on the pressing issue of climate change at various levels of governance."

      "desc": "When Greta Thunberg was returning from the COP25 in Madrid in 2019, she made planned stops along the way to engage with local activists. On a Wednesday evening, I received a call from Luisa Neubauer, the prominent face of Fridays For Future Germany, informing me of Greta's intention to stop in Turin for the weekly strike on Friday. Without wasting any time, I immediately rallied my local group and we swiftly organized the event. Recognizing the need for a stage, I reached out to the NoTAV movement, who graciously provided us with one on short notice. To ensure the event's success, I also contacted local community centers in Turin, who assisted us in gathering necessary materials for an audio system. Taking on the responsibility of security, I maintained constant communication with the Digos (police) to ensure a safe and orderly gathering. Given the significance of the occasion, we invited the press to cover the event. Managing the overwhelming response, we diligently processed over 500 media requests and issued the necessary accreditations. The strike in Turin attracted approximately 10,000 participants who eagerly gathered to hear Greta Thunberg deliver a powerful speech."
